  "Run a stored definition from its CID alone, on ClojureScript.

  This is the half `semantic-code-portable-test` never covered. That test
  proves the two runtimes AGREE ON A HASH; this one proves the hash is
  runnable on the side kotobase actually deploys to. Until now the evaluation
  layer was `.clj`, so a definition could be identified in a Worker and only
  executed on a JVM.

  There is no filesystem here on purpose. The store is an `ICodebaseStore`
  implemented in ClojureScript, which is the thing the backend seam exists to
  make possible — `backend/coerce` refuses a path on this platform rather than
  reaching for `java.nio`."
