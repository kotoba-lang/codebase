  "Identity layer 2: the CID a typed definition gets IS the payload-v2 DefCID
  `kotoba.kir.definition-identity` mints.

  The divergence suite next door pins that layer 1 answers `what is this
  definition` differently from the contract's implementation. This suite is
  the other half: under `:identity-version 2` there is one answer, layer 1 is
  untouched, and every route from one to the other either produces that same
  answer or refuses out loud.

  Layer 2 is opt-in and layer 1 is the default because layer-1 CIDs are
  published. Measured 2026-09-02: kotoba-lang `lang/package-registry.edn`
