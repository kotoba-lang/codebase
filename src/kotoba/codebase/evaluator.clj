  "Hash-native evaluation of stored semantic definitions.

  A definition is evaluated from its canonical block, and every dependency is
  hydrated from the store BY CID. No source file, no namespace, and no name is
  consulted: a definition that is reachable by hash is runnable, and renaming
  or deleting every binding that points at it changes nothing about how it
  runs.

  This is the difference between content-addressed identity and a
  content-addressed CODEBASE. The earlier local runner kept an `executable
  source witness` per definition CID and re-compiled that text before running
  it, which made the source -- not the definition graph -- the thing that had
  to be transferred, stored, and trusted, and meant a definition whose
  dependencies were all present still could not run without its file.

  Evaluation here is pure by construction: the capability intrinsics are
  rejected rather than dispatched, so a stored definition cannot acquire
  authority merely by being reachable."
