  "Verified persistence for the C1–C4 semantic-code records.

  Blocks are immutable canonical DAG-CBOR bytes keyed by CID; a namespace head
  is the one mutable pointer, moved only by compare-and-set. WHERE those bytes
  live is `kotoba.codebase.backend`'s question, not this namespace's: `root`
  may be a filesystem path (the layout this repository has always written) or
  any backend value, including one over a `kotobase.storage` provider.

  What did NOT move to the backend is every integrity rule. A block still has
  to re-encode to canonical CBOR under its CID here, an artifact still has to
  hash to its raw CID here, and a head still has to lose a race here. A store
  that checked those for us would be a store we would have to trust."
