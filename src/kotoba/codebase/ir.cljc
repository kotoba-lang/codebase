  "Structural access to the canonical semantic IR.

  `semantic-code` owns how a checked definition BECOMES canonical bytes. This
  namespace owns reading those bytes back: decoding IPLD links to CID strings,
  enumerating the definition CIDs a block depends on, and rewriting one
  dependency CID to another.

  Rewriting is what makes a Unison-style update propagate. A definition's
  dependencies are CIDs, so changing a dependency necessarily changes every
  dependent identity; the alternative -- re-parsing dependent SOURCE -- would
  reintroduce exactly the name-based resolution the semantic layer removed."
