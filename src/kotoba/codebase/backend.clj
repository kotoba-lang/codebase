(ns kotoba.codebase.backend
  "Where a codebase's bytes live — a VALUE, not a path.

  Every function in `kotoba.codebase.store` took `root`, a filesystem path, and
  reached for `java.nio` directly. That made the local layout the only possible
  one: a codebase could not live in a git object database, an S3 bucket, IPFS,
  or an erasure-coded network — not because anyone decided it should not, but
  because there was nowhere to plug one in. `fetch` already injects its
  transport; the store was the one plane still nailed to a directory.

  The seam is deliberately DUMB. It moves keyed bytes and it publishes one
  pointer. Every integrity rule stays in `store` and `fetch` where it already
  is: a block must re-encode to canonical CBOR under its CID, an artifact must
  hash to its raw CID, received bytes must be canonical before they are
  believed. A backend trusted to check those would be a backend that HAS to be
  trusted, which is the property this system exists not to need.

  Three keyed byte spaces, and one pointer:

  - `:block`    canonical DAG-CBOR. The key IS the hash of the value.
  - `:artifact` emitted raw bytes. The key IS the hash of the value.
  - `:cache`    build-cache entries. The key is NOT the hash of the value — it
                is the hash of the DESCRIPTOR the entry answers. This is the
                one table here that is not content-addressed, and it is why the
                protocol needs a pointer operation at all instead of just a
                block store. A backend built only on CID-addressed blocks has
                to express it as pointer → block.
  - head        the namespace pointer: read, and compare-and-set.

  `-put-bytes!` returns `:written`, `:identical` or `:conflict` rather than
  throwing, because the error a conflict deserves differs per space and those
  names are part of `store`'s public contract."
