(ns kotoba.codebase.fetch
  "Bounded, verified hydration of a definition closure from an outside source.

  The transport is injected, not implemented here: a block may arrive from a
  peer, a gateway, a delegated router, a USB stick. What matters is that every
  received block is checked before it is persisted, and that the check is on
  the RECEIVED BYTES.

  Two checks, not one:

  - the bytes must hash to the CID that was asked for. This is what makes an
    untrusted provider harmless -- it can serve the wrong thing, and it will be
    rejected rather than believed;
  - the bytes must be the canonical encoding of what they decode to. Without
    this a provider could ship a non-canonical CBOR encoding that decodes to
    the same block, and the store would hold bytes that re-encode to a
    different CID than the name they are filed under.

  Traversal is bounded because the links to follow come from the fetched blocks
  themselves: an adversarial DAG must not be able to turn one request into an
  unbounded fetch."
