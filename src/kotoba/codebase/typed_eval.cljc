  "Execute a typed definition by hydrating its KIR closure from the store.

  `evaluator` interprets `semantic-code`'s own IR. This runs the compiler's
  KIR through `kotoba.kir/execute` -- the executable language oracle the AOT
  and JIT backends qualify against -- so what the codebase runs and what a
  target compiles are the same representation rather than two implementations
  of an idea.

  Assembly is where the content-addressing shows: the module handed to the
  interpreter has no source names in it at all. Every function is named by its
  own CID, and every call was rewritten to a CID reference at authoring time,
  so the assembled module is a pure function of the hashes that were reachable.

  Effects are not implemented here and not silently permitted either. A
  `typed-cap-call` dispatcher may be injected by a caller that has a provider
  registry and a policy; without one, a definition that performs a capability
  call traps rather than proceeding."

;; equivalent, but `DataView` is exactly the same operation: write the bits,
;; read the float.
;;
;; `kotoba.kir` has `f64-from-bits`, and it is NOT reusable here -- it is a KIR
;; OPCODE name the interpreter dispatches on, not a function this namespace can
;; call. Worth stating because reaching for it is the obvious first move.
;;
;; An integer becomes a `bigint` on the JVM and a `js/BigInt` on cljs, which is
;; what `kotoba.kir` itself uses for i64 on that side -- its `cljs-i64`
;; docstring records why (plain cljs numbers are doubles and lose precision
;; above 2^53; cljs bitwise ops truncate to int32).
