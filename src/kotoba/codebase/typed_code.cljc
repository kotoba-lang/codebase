  "Definition identity computed from the compiler's checked KIR.

  `semantic-code` hashes a definition the codebase normalizes for itself. That
  gave content-addressed identity, but it also gave the workspace TWO answers
  to `what is this definition`: the one the codebase stores, and the one the
  compiler actually checks and lowers to a target. Nothing tied them together,
  so a definition could be stored under one identity and compiled from another,
  and neither could invalidate the other.

  Here the identity is the checked KIR itself -- the same intermediate
  representation the backends consume and qualify against. What a definition
  IS and what gets executed or compiled are then the same object, and the
  language coverage is the compiler's rather than a hand-maintained subset.

  Three things participate in identity and one deliberately does not:

  - the alpha-normalized body, so renaming a parameter is not a new definition;
  - the typed interface (parameter types, result, declared effects), so a
    signature change is a new definition even when the body is identical;
  - direct dependencies as CID links, so changing a callee necessarily changes
    every caller;
  - NOT the definition's own name, and not the names of the functions it calls.

  Alpha-normalization is verified rather than assumed. KIR has five binding
  forms (`params`, `let`, `result-match-of`, `variant-match`, `option-match`),
  and a sixth introduced later would silently leave a source-chosen name inside
  a hash. So after renaming, any surviving original binder name that is not a
  known call target fails the compile closed."
