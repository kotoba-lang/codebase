  "Hash-native authoring: scratch source in, namespace commit out.

  Authoring against a content-addressed codebase is not `edit the file that
  holds the definition`, because no file holds it. The loop is:

    1. write definitions in a scratch buffer, referring to existing work BY
       NAME;
    2. compile them against the names the namespace currently selects, which
       turns every such reference into a dependency CID;
    3. classify each result as added, updated, or unchanged by comparing the
       computed CID with the one the name selects today;
    4. propagate: rewrite every dependent so it points at the new CID, which
       necessarily gives each dependent a new identity too;
    5. commit the resulting name -> CID map as one immutable namespace commit.

  Step 4 is why definitions are rewritten rather than recompiled. A dependent's
  meaning lives in its stored IR, and its dependencies are already CIDs, so
  updating it is a substitution on the DAG. Recompiling dependent source would
  require the source to still exist and to still resolve the same names -- the
  two properties a content-addressed codebase specifically does not rely on."
