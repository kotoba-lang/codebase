(ns kotoba.codebase.actor
  "Actor code, run from its hash.

  This namespace is the binding between a content-addressed codebase and a
  state machine that stores an actor's `code` as a CID: superproject
  ADR-2608059000 makes the actor tree the base of committed state, with
  `address -> {code, state, nonce, balance}` and `code` \"the CID of a checked
  definition\". `evaluator/invoke` already runs a definition from its hash
  alone, hydrating every dependency by CID and consulting no file, namespace or
  name — which is exactly what an actor code loader is, so the loader is a
  binding rather than an implementation.

  ## The contract is a function shape, not a dependency

  `inga.state`'s `:invoke-fn` seam takes
  `{:keys [address caller code state method args fuel]}` and answers
  `{:state cid-or-nil}` or `{:refused reason}`. `invoke-fn` here returns
  exactly that. **Neither repository depends on the other**: inga injects
  crypto, quorum and hashing the same way, for the same reason — a consensus
  layer that imports one application becomes that application's consensus
  layer, and a codebase that imports a consensus layer stops being usable
  without one.

  ## What the actor sees

  The definition is applied to `[state message]`, where `state` is the value
  its own state CID decodes to (nil for an actor that has never written one)
  and `message` is `{:method :args :caller :address}`. Its return value is the
  next state: encoded with `kotoba.value.v1`, addressed, written through
  `put!`, and it is that CID the machine stores.

  Nothing else about the actor is reachable from inside. `evaluator` rejects
  the capability intrinsics rather than dispatching them, so a stored
  definition cannot acquire authority by being reachable, and this namespace
  adds no ambient argument that would hand it any.

  ## Refusal, not failure

  A replica that throws while applying a committed block has left the protocol
  while its peers produce a state and a root, so the seam must be TOTAL —
  running untrusted code is exactly where a throw is easiest to provoke. Every
  problem the evaluator or the value codec NAMES becomes a `{:refused reason}`
  from the closed set inga records.

  What is deliberately not caught is everything else. A block whose bytes do
  not hash to the CID they were fetched under (`:ipld/cid-mismatch`) is a
  storage fault, not an actor's misbehaviour, and laundering it into a refusal
  would report a corrupt store as a badly-written actor.

  ## Determinism, and where it comes from

  Two replicas must compute the same next state from the same block. That
  holds here because the definition graph is content-addressed (the same CID
  is the same code), evaluation consults nothing outside it, and
  `kotoba.value.v1` is canonical — the same value encodes to the same bytes,
  hence the same CID. It does NOT hold if a deployment points two replicas at
  stores holding different bytes under one CID, which is why the read is
  verified rather than trusted."

  absent from this table is reported as `:call-failed`, which loses detail and
  not safety."

  - `:codebase` — the store root `evaluator/invoke` reads definitions from.
  - `:get-fn` / `:put!` — the block store the actor's OWN state lives in,
    `(fn [cid] bytes)` and `(fn [cid bytes])`, the storage-port convention
    prolly-tree and ipld already use. It is the same store the actor tree is
    built in; definitions live in the codebase because that is where a
    definition's type block and dependency closure are.
  - `:max-call-depth` — optional, passed through.

  `:fuel` arrives per call from the machine and is the block's price for that
  op. **The deployment's `cost-fn` for `:actor-call` is therefore denominated
  in EVALUATION STEPS**, because that is what the budget buys here; a schedule
  priced in some other unit will refuse every call that does real work, and
  will do it deterministically enough to look like a rule."
