  "Re-address a stored `kotoba.typed-definition.v1` definition under identity
  layer 2, whose CID is the payload-v2 DefCID `kotoba.kir.definition-identity`
  mints.

  Why this is a migration and not a re-encoding: layer-1 CIDs are PUBLISHED.
  Measured 2026-09-02, kotoba-lang `lang/package-registry.edn`
  `:registry/definition-cids` names
  `bafyreif7drknz5fumncb5gqdo2jqel7hulxbzwcoohq2gsds2zm26pe6oe`; that block is
  committed at `site/assets/ipfs/` and `site/dist/ipfs/`, is inside a signed
  publication record and an ML-DSA attestation, and answers 200 from
  kotoba-lang.org and kotoba.cloud. Rewriting it in place would invalidate a
  signature over bytes other people hold. So: both layers exist, layer 1 stays
  the default and stays readable, and moving is an explicit act with a record.

  ## What cannot be migrated, and why saying so is the point

  Two v1 shapes are refused rather than approximated:

  - a recursive group (`kotoba.typed-group.v1` / `.typed-member.v1`), because
    layer 2 seals dependencies as CIDs and a cycle has no CID;
  - an effect row that layer 1 already stringified. `typed-code`'s
    `stable-name` falls through to `str`, so a compiler wire row was stored as
    the STRING \"[:cap/call 9]\". Parsing that back would mean guessing that
    the string denotes wire id 9 and then guessing the operation the catalog
    names for it -- two guesses sealed into an identity. The id is recoverable
    only from the catalog that was in force when the block was written, which
    the block does not record. Refusing keeps the guess out of the hash.

  A definition whose effects were stored as ordinary operation names migrates
  fine: those ARE the sealed vocabulary."
